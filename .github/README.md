# 2D Fluid Simulation  
Welcome to my try to create a praticle based viscoelastic fluid simulation, focusing on liquids. This project is created as part one of my specialization project course in school.

## Why? 
A good question to ask is why I do this. And well, to be honest, fluids is just a fantastic thing. I think everyone have been out in the water, splashing pudles and having fun. So this project is more or less just a satisfying try to see water dropletts behave on a 2d screen, dodging rigid bodies and getting manipulated through player input.
But the biggest reason is just to expand my knowledge in both programming and physics to see what innovative things that could be done to maybe, in a short future, have real time physics based water simulations in games.

## Required specs and similar
A fairly powerful computer, but feel free to try the limits of what this can run on.  
Visual Studio Community, 2022 or newer

## Legal Information  
The base of this project is a fork of Sumo Digital Limited (Spyderâ„¢) repo called [Playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer?tab=readme-ov-file).  
For my own part is this just a test to see how everything works in 2D. The real deal and whats for me would matter is my 3D repo which is built using my spectra-wise engine. So what this repo gets used for is in the hands of the reader as long as you follow the Legal section of playbuffer.
